# Auto-Manager Email Fix Summary

## üö® Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Database Schema Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Missing `created_at` column in `email_logs` table
**Solution**: Run `fix-email-logs-quick.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### 2. Email Queue Format Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ  
**Problem**: Email logs missing `order_id` and `email_type` fields
**Solution**: Updated standalone-auto-manager.js to include proper fields

### 3. API Connection Error - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Auto-close API trying to call email service endpoint causing ECONNREFUSED
**Solution**: Removed the problematic API call from auto-close route

## üìã What You Need to Do Now:

### Step 1: Fix Database Schema
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `fix-email-logs-quick.sql`:

```sql
-- Fix email_logs table to include created_at column
ALTER TABLE email_logs 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW();

-- Update existing records if they have null created_at
UPDATE email_logs 
SET created_at = updated_at 
WHERE created_at IS NULL;

-- Make sure the column is not null going forward
ALTER TABLE email_logs 
ALTER COLUMN created_at SET NOT NULL;
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Fixed Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix auto-manager email system issues"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically redeploy with the fixes.

### Step 3: Test the System
After deployment, the next time an order expires, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Order closes successfully 
- ‚úÖ Shop status updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Emails get queued properly
- ‚úÖ No more connection errors

## üîç What Was Happening:

1. **Auto-manager was working correctly** - it closed the order
2. **Database schema was incomplete** - missing required columns in email_logs
3. **API endpoint was making unnecessary calls** - causing connection refused errors
4. **Email queue wasn't being populated properly** - wrong field names

## ‚úÖ After the Fix:

The system will:
- Close expired orders ‚úÖ
- Update shop status ‚úÖ 
- Queue emails properly ‚úÖ
- Email service will process the queue separately ‚úÖ
- No more connection errors ‚úÖ

The email will be sent by your existing email service that runs independently!
