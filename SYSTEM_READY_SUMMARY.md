## ‚ö†Ô∏è What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional settings
AUTO_MANAGE_LOG_LEVEL=info
AUTO_MANAGE_DRY_RUN=false
```

### 2. Test the System (SAFE - Won't Affect Your Orders)

Double-click or run:
```bash
test-auto-manager.bat
```

This will show you exactly what the system would do WITHOUT making any actual changes.

### 3. Set Up the Cron Job

Once you're satisfied with the test results:

1. **Right-click** `setup-auto-manager.bat`
2. **Select "Run as Administrator"** 
3. Follow the prompts

This will create a Windows Task Scheduler job that runs every 10 minutes.

### 4. Monitor and Control

Use the control panel:
```bash
manage-auto-manager.bat
```

This gives you options to:
- View task status
- Check logs
- Start/stop the system
- Run manual tests

## üîß System Configuration

### Default Settings
- **Schedule**: Runs every 10 minutes
- **Auto-close time**: 15 minutes after order creation
- **Log level**: Info (shows important events)
- **Log location**: `logs/auto-manager.log`

### How It Works
1. **Auto-Opening**: Orders with `status = 'scheduled'` and `opening_time <= now()` become `active`
2. **Auto-Closing**: Orders with `status = 'active'` and `created_at + 15 minutes <= now()` become `closed`

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Dry run mode**: Test without making changes
- **Detailed logging**: Track all actions
- **Error handling**: Continues running even if some operations fail
- **Database validation**: Checks connections before processing
- **Manual control**: Start, stop, or disable anytime

## üö® Important Notes

1. **ALWAYS test first** using `test-auto-manager.bat`
2. **Review the test results** to understand what will happen
3. **The system will NOT affect your current orders** until you explicitly enable it
4. **You can stop or disable it anytime** using the control panel

## üìä Next Steps

1. **Set your environment variables** in `.env.local`
2. **Run the test** with `test-auto-manager.bat` 
3. **If test looks good**, run `setup-auto-manager.bat` as Administrator
4. **Monitor the system** with `manage-auto-manager.bat`

## üéâ That's It!

The system will automatically:
- Open scheduled orders when their time arrives
- Close expired orders after 15 minutes
- Log all activities for your review
- Run reliably every 10 minutes

All syntax errors have been fixed, and the system is production-ready! üöÄ
